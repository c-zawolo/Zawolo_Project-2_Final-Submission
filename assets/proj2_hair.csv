Month,flavortxt
Aug 2022,My first set of twists and the beginning of a running gag. Every year on August 10th I take a photo of myself doing the dreamworks face. If you don't know what that is look it up
Oct 2022,"The first time I had done my own twists, as prior, I had them done by a family-friend who owns a hairstyling business."
Nov 2022,First time doing my twists more than once in a month 
Dec 2022,Looking back I noticed a significant drop of photos of myself from this month. I remember being embarrassed. Seems trivial now
Jan 2023,Turned 20 on 1/5 
Feb 2023,More twists done by myself
Mar 2023,February and March's photos were taken in the same place & (probably) the same outfit
Apr 2023,Start of the longest interval without a retwist
May 2023,End of longest interval without at retwist
Jun 2023,"For most of the summer, I got my mom to do my hair for me"
Jul 2023,Words can't embody how thankful I was for my mom doing my hair for me. It's a tedious process
Aug 2023,"As my goal of a year of growth had been achieved, I decided now was time to leave them in to begin properly locing"
Sep 2023,I remember a bout of being terrified of shampoo residue in my hair. There was none
Oct 2023,I received a retwist that shattered my confidence. Don't experiment with stylists if you don't have to
Nov 2023,"My two-strand twists were twisted together in the previous month, so I took them down"
Dec 2023,"This month is best encapsulated with ""waiting for brighter days"" aka: ""winter break so I could have my regular stylist fix my hair."""
Jan 2024,"Fresh, fixed twists. Perfect for turning 21 on 1/5"
Feb 2024,Tbh I just like this photo
Mar 2024,"The sides of my hair were at one point faded. I had it just growing, as the top covered it. It was getting too long so I had it braided "
Apr 2024,Thank God locs are low maintenance. I had no time to spare during this finals season.
May 2024,The reason I had the sides braided was to avoid this inconvenience. 
Jun 2024,Had my undercut loc'd up.
Jul 2024,An example of frizzy locs with parts that don't show 
Aug 2024,Leftover beads from a vacation styling. Two years!!!
Sep 2024,"My ""current"" length blows my mind. This much already?"
Oct 2024,I haven't gotten a retwist since June. Checked recently and my loctician is booked through November.
